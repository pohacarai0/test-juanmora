# 👋 How to Help Improve Our Platform!

Hi Team! 👋

Thanks for helping us squash bugs and make our platform better for everyone! Your reports are incredibly valuable because you see what our customers experience firsthand.

This short guide explains the best way to report issues you encounter. Following these steps helps our development team understand the problem quickly and fix it faster! 🚀

## 🐞 Reporting Bugs

Found something broken or not working as expected? Please let us know!

**How to Report:**

1.  **Go to the Issues Tab:** Click on the "Issues" tab at the top of this repository page, or just click this link: [Create a New Issue](https://github.com/iMusicianOps/desk/issues/new/choose) (You might need to log in to GitHub).
2.  **Choose the Right Template:** You'll see different templates for reporting issues. Please pick the one that best matches the problem:
    * **🎨 UI/Frontend Bug Report:** Use this for visual glitches, layout problems, button issues, or anything related to how the platform *looks* and *feels*.
    * **🐞 Bug Report (General):** Use this for other types of bugs, like errors when saving data, unexpected calculations, or features not working correctly behind the scenes.
    *(If you're unsure, the general Bug Report is okay!)*
3.  **📝 Fill Out ALL the Details:** Each template has specific questions. Please fill out *every section* as accurately as possible.
    * **Describe the bug:** What exactly is wrong?
    * **Steps to Reproduce:** This is super important! Tell us the *exact* steps someone else can follow to see the bug too. (Example: 1. Go to page X. 2. Click button Y. 3. See error Z.)
    * **Expected Behavior:** What *should* have happened?
    * **Screenshots/Videos:** A picture is worth a thousand words! If you can, please add a screenshot or even a short screen recording (you can link to services like Loom or just upload the image). 📸
    * **Environment:** Information like browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) can sometimes help.
4.  **Submit!** Once you've filled everything out, click "Submit new issue".

**Why are the details important?** 🤔
The more information you provide upfront (like clear steps, what you expected, and screenshots), the faster our developers can understand, replicate, and fix the problem without needing to ask lots of follow-up questions.

## ✨ Feature Requests or Ideas?

While the main focus here is bugs, if you have ideas for new features or improvements based on customer feedback, feel free to create an issue as well! If we add a specific "Feature Request" template later, please use that. Otherwise, use the general "Bug Report" template for now and make it clear it's a suggestion.
